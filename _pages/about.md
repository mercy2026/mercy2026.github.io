Mercy Koranteng 

Computer Programmer 

As a computer engineer and programmer who got their experience from Oracle, I know I will use my abilities to enhance productivity when it comes to creating databases. I have not had a job before, but I am ready to use my skills in order to effectively help the company go into the right direction. 

Examples of my achievements include: 

-I created a Breakout Ball Game on Green Foot using JavaScript, my freshmen year in the Information Technology Oracle Academy program. It was easy to play understand so anybody could play it. 
-In the ITOA program I was able to learn how to create different databases and what they are used for. Plus, I learned how to track and maintain information in a database. During this process I also learned SQL and almost got my SQL certification. 

-Before joining the ITOA program I was involved in another program over the summer. This program was for girls who wanted to learn more about coding and engineering. Here I was able to experience and learn what it was like to program and get a motherboard to work. At the end of the program, we got a certificate for how much we improved. 

As an average professional in the basic background of coding, engineering, managing databases, and Java. I can assure you that I will grow to become a great asset to your company and respectfully submit my application for your review. I would like to request a meeting to further discuss what I can do to meet your future goals/expectations. I am available at your convenience and hope to hear from you soon. 

Thank you for your consideration 
Sincerely, 
Mercy Koranteng

​​    EXPERIENCE​ 
  ITOA Program 
2022-PRESENT 
Developed Games and websites using Java programming language on code.org, GreenFoot and Alice. Also, learning how to create and manage different databases. Along with finding trends in the database to help make connections within them. Which can help to build a business.  

  Engineering Program for Girls 
2021
Used TinkerCad to learn how to engineer a motherboard and get it to work. Along with bits of coding. We would usually work by ourselves, but if we had problems with not getting it to work together to fix them. At the end we got a certificate for our hard work. 

  APG Engineering Program 
2024 
Used different objects and items to build things such as cars, and then used TinkerCad to 3D print wheels for the cars so I can move faster. This program had us learning from our trial and error, but we would soon come up with a solution as a team. We also learned about different 3D printers and their effect on society.
